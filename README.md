# Threat-Hunting-and-Advance-Security-Monitoring

## Objective

Cyber threats are evolving rapidly, and traditional defenses aren’t enough. I have build a system that not only detects threats but also responds automatically—reducing manual work and improving incident response time.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of threat detection and SIEM operations using Wazuh and Splunk.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network and endpoint security logs.
- Expertise in integrating and automating security workflows with LimaCharlie, Tines, and Slack.
- Strong knowledge of IDS/IPS mechanisms, network protocols, and security vulnerabilities.
- Hands-on experience in cloud security monitoring and incident response in Azure.

### Tools Used

- Wazuh – SIEM and endpoint detection for log analysis, threat monitoring, and security event correlation.
- Suricata – IDS/IPS for deep packet inspection, network traffic analysis, and real-time threat detection.
- LimaCharlie – Centralized threat detection and response, including automated device isolation.
- Splunk – Log management, security analytics, and event correlation for advanced threat detection.
- Tines – Security automation for orchestrating threat response workflows and alerting.
- Slack – Integrated for real-time security notifications and team collaboration.
- Iris – Digital forensics and incident response tool for threat intelligence and investigation.
- Azure – Cloud platform for hosting and managing security monitoring infrastructure.
